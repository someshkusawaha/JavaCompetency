	have even numbers and all are distinct. 
	Note: By the property of sets, if two subsets have the same set of elements then they are 
	considered as one. For example: [2, 4, 8] and [4, 2, 8] are considered to be the same. 
	Your Task:  
	You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the 
	function countSubsets() which takes the array a[] and its size n as inputs and returns the 
	Count of possible subsets.
